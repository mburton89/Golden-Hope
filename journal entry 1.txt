       I’ve reached the entrance of the underground. I can hardly believe that I actually found it. It was just like the legends say, though. I went west, and I found it. It was kinda weird, not going to lie. I was walking… and suddenly the setting sun shone too brightly in my eyes, blinding me. When it went away, there it was: the cave entrance.
	I have to say, it took me a bit to brace myself before I headed in. I mean, the old man had told me that I’d best have nothing to lose. But I know that I have now. I have nothing if I don’t do this. I guess a lot of people have said so in the past, but I mean it.
