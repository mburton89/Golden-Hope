Well look at that. You actually found someone to help.
Don’t sound so surprised.
You never heard me do the talking before, so it’s not like I never had the skill. 
Fair enough… I guess.
Hmph.
What?
That was just… easier than I thought it would be.
Eh… 
Well things are put into more perspective when you’re dead.
Good for you, Hope.
Anyway, your new friend should be able to help out whenever you ask them.
