Golden, we need to get out of here!
Um… maybe you’re right.
Yes, run away! You’re not strong enough to make it to the next level!
You know what? On second thought, I think I’ll stay.
WHAT?!?!?
You can’t beat this creature. It’s too strong!
Can too! And I will! I have to get to that fruit!
Golden, listen to me! This isn’t worth it! Turn back now!
The fruit will never be reached. It’s not even there.
It is there! I’ve given everything for it already, so what’s a little more?
