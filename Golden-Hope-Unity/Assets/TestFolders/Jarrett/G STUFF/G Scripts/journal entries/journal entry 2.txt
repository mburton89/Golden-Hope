       Why is it so dark in here?!? I have to use up my torches just to write this! I know I shouldn't be so upset, and I shouldn't waste the light, but I need to get this out...
	I just can't get over how stupid this all is. Everything in my life just had to go and get ruined. One thing after another until everything I ever had was just destroyed. Gone.
	And now I'm here, in this awful place, with all these creatures here trying to kill me. And for what? A fruit that might not even be here? A fruit that might not even work? 
	It all just seems to not be worth the trouble...
