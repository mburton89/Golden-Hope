Awesome. There’s the next level’s entrance. Let’s go, Hope.
Hold up, Golden. 
This leads to some messed up stuff. You sure you can just walk through?
What are you talking about, Hope? We’ll be fine.
Yes. That’s right. Nothing’s even here.
Huh? 
…
Hope, did you hear something?
No…
Don’t tell me you’re losing it already, Golden.
Oh shut up. I’m not going crazy. 
This place is just full of things that want to fool me. 
You said so yourself. Nothing here makes any sense.
Exactly. Nothing here makes sense. Nothing can hurt you…
Who’s there? Show yourself!
No one’s here. It’s just your imagination.
Okay. Now I hear it.
