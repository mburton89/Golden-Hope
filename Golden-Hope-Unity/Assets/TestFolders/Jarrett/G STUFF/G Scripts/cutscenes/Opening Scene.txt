Ugh...
What? Wh-where am I...? 
Did I make it?
*groaning*
AHH!
Golden, you idiot! What are you doing here?
Hope? But you were-!
Yeah, I know. But I'm here now, so don't complain.
N-no! I'm not complaining! I'm just... You're here! Alive!
Uh... woah there, buddy. I'm not alive. 
I mean, look at me. Do I look alive to you?
... 
Oh.
So are you going to explain to me what you're doing here now?
Well... I, uh-
You're going for that fruit, obviously. 
Didn't you hear mom? She said it didn't exist. 
No point in putting yourself in danger.
It doesn't matter how dangerous it is, Hope. This is for mom.
I... I know it's for mom, but is it worth risking your life for?
Maybe it is.
We said we wouldn't go after this wild goose chase. You even said yourself that-
That was before you died. And now that you're gone... I just can't keep it up. 
Either you somehow come back... or I do this.
I understand... 
But are you sure you have nothing to lose? 
You still have your whole life ahead of you, right?
Heh. What kind of life would that really be anymore? 
Running away from the past and subjecting mom to it?
Golden-
If I die, then I die. What else can I do? 
This will save mom for good.
Ugh! You're so stubborn! Fine. I'll help you. 
No use in healing mom if both her children are dead. 
But first, we should probably get you out of this dungeon?
