AAAHHHHHHHH!!!
WOAH! 
Thank you! 
That thing was gonna kill me! Can you believe it?!?!?
Actually, I can.
Hope, be nice.
What were you doing out here, little fella?
I'm on an adventure!!!
Really? What kind?
Uh...! 
An... 
Adventurous Adventure!
*laughs* Good for you! 
But it's pretty dangerous to be all by yourself out here. Do you want to come with us?
*groans*
Sure! You saved my gelatin! I'd be happy to help you!
You're befriending monsters now, Golden? 
And specifically after I told you not to?
When did you tell me not to do that...?
*grumbles*
