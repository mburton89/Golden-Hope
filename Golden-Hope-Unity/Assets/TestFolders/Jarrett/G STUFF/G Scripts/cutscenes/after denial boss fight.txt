Wow... 
You... you actually did it!
I did.
What's the matter? You sound upset.
Upset, huh? Is that how I sound to you, Hope?
Um...?
You didn't believe in me back there! This whole time you haven't! 
You've been acting like I need your protection! Well I don't! I don't need your help!
You don't mean that.
Don't I? 
The only thing you've been any help with is telling me what things are and aren't, and sometimes you're still wrong! 
It's just... not like you.
Golden-!
I know. You can only do so much. 
Well you can try doing nothing for a change. Maybe that'll be better!
It's not my fault you couldn't save me!
...
...
Shut up, Hope.
