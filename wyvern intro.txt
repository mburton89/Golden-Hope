Ahhh! Don’t go any further! Just back right out of here!
Is that a—?
Yes, and a very angry one! Now let’s go!
Why are you here, human?
Uh… well—
The fruit, I would assume.
Y-yes.
*huffs* Of course. 
You humans are all the same. Greedy bunch. 
Makes me want to destroy that wretched tree once and for all.
No! Don’t do that! 
Please! I need it!
Of course you do. 
And for what reason, exactly, do you seek the golden fruit?
To… to save my mother. She’s dying.
… 
You wish to save her?
Yes. 
Hm… 
Very well. I will help you.
WHAT?!?!?
I will fight your battles alongside you. 
But I have one condition.
Okay…?
Once you receive your wish, you allow me to destroy the tree. Some are not as noble as you seem to be.
… 
Deal.
Ugh! Great! 
We’re gonna regret this! Mark my words!
If you disappoint me, yes. You will.
