       First, Ahriman took his sword and destroyed it. He brought it to the judges who told him that it wasn’t enough. So Ahriman returned to his village again and decided to slaughter all the livestock he owned. When he returned to the judges, they rejected him again once he showed them what he had done. This time, the second judge to the fairy, a wyvern, told Ahriman to ‘not return here until you truly destroy your pride’.
	For the final time, Ahriman returned to the village and sought out his betrothed. Once he had found her, he brought her before the judges and killed her before their eyes. And, as the girl’s blood seeped into the soil, the hill shook and the golden fruits on the tree withered and died. The hill imploded, sending the tree, the guardians, and Ahriman into the underground. This ensured no more could reach the fruit ever again.
	However, because of the goodness in the slain maiden, the tree sprouted a singular fruit, which Ahriman took and ate, making the hasty wish to “live forever”. The goblin opened a way of escape for Ahriman, opening a way to the tree. In retaliation, the eight judges hid the entrance and created tunnels to confuse and trap all those who entered. The creatures could not leave, bound forever to the tree and the soul purpose of protecting it.
