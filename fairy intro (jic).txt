Ugh. Another one of those fairies. 
Little buggers and their stupid magic. 
Not to mention: they bite!
They look a little worried about something.
Probably looking to cause trouble. Who cares? 
Let’s try out luck in a different room.
Hello? Do you need help?
You idiot!
Excuse me?!?
What did you call me, shadow being?
I wasn’t talking to you!
Hmph! Right! 
You! Human! You asked a question?
Just wondering if something’s wrong.
I’ll say! 
Some goblin took my magic essence, and now I’m all sorts of messed up! Can’t aim straight! 
I swear, those goblins ruin everything!
Could we help, possibly?
You’re kidding, right?
You’re kidding right?
You little—!
No. I mean it.
Hmph. Maybe… 
You do to need a guide around here if you’ve any chance of getting out alive.
I’m taking care of that!
I’m taking care of that! Sure you are.
Anyway, kid, sure. If you’re interested in helping, maybe you could be useful. 
But I’m gonna hold you to it. Got it?
Understood. You help me, I help you.
Done. I’ll do my best to help you fight. 
Though I can’t guarantee anything. You know… since my magic’s all sorts of screwy.
