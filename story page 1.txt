       The Golden Fruit is a legend of great mystery. Many have ventured in search of it. None have returned to tell the tale.
	The fruit is said to grant any one wish to those who are able to obtain it. It also holds healing properties, capable of ridding one of any diseases in existence. Even one portion of a fruit would be worth a great fortune. Much sacrifice is required to obtain such power, so any who go in search of it should have nothing to lose.
	However, while once easily accessible, the tree bearing the fruit now grows deep in an underground cavern, hidden from the eyes of mortals. Even if one were to find the underground, it is guarded by horrible monstrosities, warding off all those who wish to abuse the fruit’s power.
	 It is said that in order to find the entrance to the cavern, one must meet the sunset at the horizon. Only then, will the cavern be opened.
