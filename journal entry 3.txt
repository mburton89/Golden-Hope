       Maybe I could reason with the underground. It certainly feels alive to me, somehow. Maybe it would be willing to make a deal with me? But what could I offer a sentient labyrinth?
	I don’t know. I just want to make this at least a little bit easier on myself. The air down here is just so… strange. I don’t know if I’ll be able to handle it. There’s got to be a way to make this easier for me.
	Not to mention having a few less of these monsters on my back would be helpful. They all seem so bloody-thirsty, it’s starting to get me worried.
	Maybe I could convince some of them not to attack me? Maybe even help…?
